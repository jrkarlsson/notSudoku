# notSudoku
A small programming exercise. There are probably lots of room for improvement in all parts of this little project but decided to call it a day and move on to the next exercise. Perhaps in the future.

Example: http://jrkarlsson.github.io/notSudoku.html

Suggested improvements:
  * Generate true sudoku-puzzles i.e. puzzles with only one solution.
  * Better validation, perhaps somehow get around the almost constant double-loops.
  * CSS could be better.
